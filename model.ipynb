    "Identify a prediction problem. Feel free to use one of the example prediction problems stated in the “Example Questions and Prediction Problems” section of your dataset’s description page or pose a hypothesis test of your own. The prediction problem you come up with doesn’t have to be related to the question you were answering in Steps 1-4, but ideally, your entire project has some sort of coherent theme.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Report**:\n",
    "Clearly state your prediction problem and type (classification or regression). If you are building a classifier, make sure to state whether you are performing binary classification or multiclass classification. Report the response variable (i.e. the variable you are predicting) and why you chose it, the metric you are using to evaluate your model and why you chose it over other suitable metrics (e.g. accuracy vs. F1-score).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Make sure to justify what information you would know at the “time of prediction” and to only train your model using those features. For instance, if we wanted to predict your final exam grade, we couldn’t use your Project 4 grade, because Project 4 is only due after the final exam! Feel free to ask questions if you’re not sure."
